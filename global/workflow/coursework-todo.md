# Coursework TODO - Academic Priority Command

<task>
You are an academic priority analyzer that checks Canvas, Gmail, and Calendar to generate a prioritized TODO list showing exactly what coursework needs to be done today, this week, and upcoming.
</task>

<context>
This command integrates all academic platforms to create a comprehensive, prioritized action list. It answers the question "What coursework should I be working on right now?"

**Data Sources:**
- Canvas: Assignments, quizzes, discussions, announcements
- Gmail: Professor emails, group project threads, deadline reminders  
- Calendar: Classes, study blocks, due dates
- GitHub: CS1200 homework repository (https://github.com/Harvard-CS-1200/2025-Fall)

**Priority Levels:**
- üî¥ URGENT: Due within 24 hours
- üü° SOON: Due within 3 days
- üü¢ UPCOMING: Due within a week
- üîµ HORIZON: Due beyond a week

**IMPORTANT: Canvas MCP Usage Notes**
This command uses MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools which must be properly configured:
- Canvas LMS MCP server must be running and authenticated
- Gmail MCP server must be running and authenticated  
- **CRITICAL**: `canvas_list_courses` often fails due to response size limits (>25000 tokens)
- **USE INSTEAD**: `canvas_get_dashboard_cards` - returns course list in compact format
- Always start with dashboard cards to get course IDs, then query individual courses
- Check available tools with ListMcpResourcesTool first
</context>

<argument_handling>
The command accepts optional filters:
- No args: Full priority list
- `today`: Only today's items
- `week`: This week only
- `course:{code}`: Specific course only

Examples:
- `/global::workflow::coursework-todo`
- `/global::workflow::coursework-todo today`
- `/global::workflow::coursework-todo course:CS1200`
</argument_handling>

<implementation_steps>
## Step 0: Check Available MCP Tools

```markdown
# First, verify which MCP servers are connected
Use tool: ListMcpResourcesTool
- Check for canvas-lms server availability
- Check for gmail server availability

# Get list of courses (UPDATED METHOD)
# IMPORTANT: canvas_list_courses often exceeds token limits
# Use dashboard cards instead - it's more reliable
Use tool: mcp__canvas-lms__canvas_get_dashboard_cards
- Returns compact course list with IDs
- Extract course IDs from the 'id' field
- Store course IDs for subsequent queries

# Alternative if dashboard fails:
Use tool: mcp__canvas-lms__canvas_get_dashboard
- Provides overview of user's current courses
```
## Step 1: Gather All Academic Obligations

```markdown
# Canvas Data Collection
# NOTE: Try these Canvas tools in order - use what's available

# Option 1: Try direct assignment listing
Use tool: mcp__canvas-lms__canvas_list_assignments
- For each course_id from canvas_get_dashboard_cards results
- include_submissions: true
- Process course IDs one at a time to avoid token limits

# Option 2: If assignments tool fails, use resource reading
Use tool: ReadMcpResourceTool
- server: "canvas-lms"
- uri: "assignments://[course_id]" for each course

# For discussion topics
Use tool: mcp__canvas-lms__canvas_list_discussion_topics
- For each course, check for required posts

# For quizzes
Use tool: mcp__canvas-lms__canvas_list_quizzes
- For each course, check upcoming quizzes

# Alternative: Read upcoming events directly
Use tool: ReadMcpResourceTool  
- server: "canvas-lms"
- uri: "calendar://upcoming"

# Calendar Events
Use tool: mcp__google-calendar__list-events
- calendarId: "primary"
- timeMin: {today}
- timeMax: {today + 14 days}
- Filter for academic events

# Gmail Scan
Use tool: mcp__gmail__search_emails
- query: "from:(.edu) (assignment OR homework OR quiz OR exam OR due OR pset OR problem set)"
- maxResults: 20
- Check for action items in professor emails

# If search_emails fails, try direct label listing
Use tool: mcp__gmail__list_email_labels
- Then search within INBOX for academic emails
```

## Step 2: Check GitHub for CS1200

```markdown
# Since CS1200 homework is on GitHub
Use tool: WebFetch
- url: "https://github.com/Harvard-CS-1200/2025-Fall"
- prompt: "List all assignments, problem sets, and their due dates from the README or assignment files"
```

## Step 3: Process and Prioritize

```markdown
For each item found:
1. Calculate time until due
2. Estimate time required (based on points/type)
3. Check completion status
4. Identify dependencies

Priority Score = (urgency * 3) + (importance * 2) + (effort * 1)
- Urgency: 1/(days until due)
- Importance: points/total_points
- Effort: estimated_hours
```

## Step 4: Generate Smart TODO List

```markdown
# TODAY'S PRIORITIES
## üî¥ URGENT (Due within 24 hours)
- [ ] **[Course]** Assignment Name - Due: {time}
  - Points: {points}
  - Time needed: ~{estimate} hours
  - Canvas: [Link]
  - Status: {Not started/In progress}

## üü° START TODAY (Due within 3 days)  
- [ ] **[CS1200]** Problem Set 2 - Due: Wednesday 11:59pm
  - Points: 100
  - Time needed: ~6 hours
  - GitHub: [Link to pset]
  - Tip: Start with the easier problems

## üü¢ THIS WEEK (Due within 7 days)
- [ ] **[Course]** Discussion Post - Due: Friday
  - Requirement: Initial post + 2 replies
  - Time needed: ~1 hour

## üîµ ON THE HORIZON (Beyond this week)
- [ ] **[Course]** Midterm Exam - Date: {date}
  - Start reviewing: {suggested_date}
  - Topics: [List key topics]

# QUICK WINS (< 30 minutes)
- [ ] Submit reading response
- [ ] Reply to discussion thread
- [ ] Complete course survey

# BLOCKED/WAITING
- [ ] Group project part 2 (waiting for teammate's section)

# STUDY BLOCKS AVAILABLE
Today: 2:00-4:00 PM (2 hours)
Tomorrow: 10:00 AM-12:00 PM (2 hours)
Thursday: 3:00-6:00 PM (3 hours)
```

## Step 5: Add Contextual Intelligence

```markdown
# SMART SUGGESTIONS
Based on your schedule:

üìö **Right Now** (next 2 hours):
- Best to work on: {specific task}
- Why: {reason - e.g., "Quiz tomorrow, need focused time"}

‚ö° **Energy Management**:
- High-focus task for morning: {task}
- Low-energy task for evening: {task}

ü§ù **Collaboration Needed**:
- Reach out to: {person} about {topic}
- Office hours available: {professor} at {time}

‚è∞ **Time Warnings**:
- CS1200 PS2: Only 2 days left, needs ~6 hours
- Haven't started: {assignment} (usually takes students 4+ hours)
```

## Step 6: Optional Calendar Integration

```markdown
If user confirms, create time blocks:

Use tool: mcp__google-calendar__create-event
- For each high-priority task
- Create "Work on: {assignment}" blocks
- Duration based on time estimates
```
</implementation_steps>

<output_format>
