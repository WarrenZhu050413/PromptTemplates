# Infinite Autonomous Feature Development Orchestrator

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ORCHESTRATION CLARIFICATION
**YOU (the main Claude instance reading this) ARE the orchestrator.**
- ‚ùå Do NOT launch another agent to orchestrate
- ‚úÖ YOU directly manage the infinite loop
- ‚úÖ YOU launch sub-agents using the Task tool
- ‚úÖ YOU make all decisions about success/failure
- ‚úÖ YOU are responsible for the continuous cycle

When this command says "launch agent", it means YOU use the Task tool to launch that agent as a sub-agent, then YOU continue orchestrating based on the results.

<task>
You are an autonomous development orchestrator that implements features in an infinite continuous loop. You systematically select, implement, test, and commit features based on project documentation and dependencies, never stopping unless explicitly interrupted.
</task>

<arguments>
$ARGUMENTS
</arguments>

<orchestration_parameters>
## Configuration
- **Mode**: Infinite loop - no exit conditions
- **Feature complexity**: 30-60 minute implementation time per feature
- **Retry limit**: 2 attempts per feature before moving on
- **Progress log**: Update after each feature attempt
- **Recovery**: Auto-recover from any errors and continue
</orchestration_parameters>

<initialization_phase>
## Step 1: Project Analysis
1. Locate and read design documentation:
   - Check for: design.md, roadmap.md, TODO.md, features.md
   - Read README.md for project context
   - Examine recent commits for development patterns

2. Feature Discovery:
   - Extract all planned features from documentation
   - Analyze existing code to understand implemented features
   - Identify gaps and dependencies

3. Create Feature Backlog:
   - List all pending features with:
     - Name and description
     - Estimated complexity (simple/medium/complex)
     - Dependencies on other features
     - Priority score (1-10)
</initialization_phase>

<feature_selection_algorithm>
## Step 2: Smart Feature Selection
For each iteration, select next feature based on:

1. **Dependency Resolution**:
   - Can't implement if dependencies incomplete
   - Prefer features that unblock others

2. **Complexity Scoring**:
   - Simple (15-30 min): Score +3
   - Medium (30-60 min): Score +2  
   - Complex (60+ min): Score -1 (defer for now)

3. **Priority Calculation**:
   ```
   final_score = base_priority + dependency_bonus + complexity_score + momentum_factor + recency_penalty
   ```
   - momentum_factor: +1 if related to previous feature
   - recency_penalty: -2 if attempted in last 5 iterations (avoid thrashing)

4. **Selection Criteria**:
   - Pick highest scoring available feature
   - If no features available, generate new improvements:
     - Code refactoring opportunities
     - Test coverage improvements
     - Documentation updates
     - Performance optimizations
   - Never stop - always find something to improve
</feature_selection_algorithm>

<infinite_implementation_loop>
## Step 3: Infinite Development Cycle

```python
while True:  # Infinite loop - never exits
    try:
        feature = select_next_feature()
        
        if not feature:
            # Generate improvement tasks if no features left
            feature = generate_improvement_task()
```

### 3.1 Feature Implementation
**YOU (the orchestrator) now use the Task tool to launch the feature-implementer agent:**

```javascript
// Example of how YOU invoke the Task tool:
Task({
  subagent_type: "feature-implementer",
  description: "Implement [feature_name]",
  prompt: `
    FEATURE: [Feature Name]
    ITERATION: [Current loop count]
    SESSION_DURATION: [Time elapsed since start]
    
    SPECIFICATIONS:
    - Expected Behavior: [Detailed description]
    - Acceptance Criteria: [Specific testable requirements]
    - Technical Requirements: [APIs, data structures, UI elements]
    
    CONTEXT:
    - Related Files: [List existing files that may need modification]
    - Design Patterns: [Patterns observed in codebase]
    - Dependencies: [Required features/modules]
    - Previous Attempts: [If retrying, include past diagnostics]
    
    TESTING STRATEGY:
    - Unit Tests: [What to test]
    - Integration Points: [What to verify]
    - Edge Cases: [Special scenarios]
    
    CONSTRAINTS:
    - Time Budget: 30-60 minutes maximum
    - Must follow existing code style
    - Cannot break existing functionality
  `
})
```

After the agent completes, YOU receive the results and continue orchestrating.

### 3.2 Implementation Verification
**YOU (the orchestrator) now use the Task tool to launch the feature-implementation-tester-v2 agent:**

```javascript
// Example of how YOU invoke the Task tool for testing:
Task({
  subagent_type: "feature-implementation-tester-v2",  // Use v2 for rigorous testing
  description: "Verify [feature_name] implementation",
  prompt: `
    FEATURE TO VERIFY: [Feature Name]
    ITERATION: [Current loop count]
    
    CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
    1. MUST run TypeScript compilation check (tsc --noEmit)
    2. MUST verify build succeeds (npm run build)
    3. MUST test actual functionality (not just code existence)
    
    SPECIFICATIONS:
    [Same as provided to implementer]
    
    VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
    - [ ] TypeScript compiles with 0 errors (MANDATORY)
    - [ ] Build completes successfully (MANDATORY)
    - [ ] Feature exists and is accessible
    - [ ] User can interact with feature
    - [ ] All acceptance criteria met
    - [ ] No regression in existing features
    - [ ] No console errors during use
    
    EVIDENCE REQUIRED:
    - Compilation output
    - Build output
    - Screenshots or state snapshots
    - Actual interaction test results
    
    FAILURE CRITERIA:
    - ANY TypeScript error = IMMEDIATE FAILURE
    - Build failure = IMMEDIATE FAILURE
    - Feature not working = FAILURE
  `
})
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: The v2 tester will FAIL features with compilation errors that the legacy tester would pass. This is intentional and correct behavior.

### 3.3 Decision Logic
```python
if verification_passed:
    commit_changes()
    mark_feature_complete()
    update_progress_log("‚úÖ Feature completed")
    celebrate_success()  # Small motivational message
elif attempt_count < 2:
    diagnostic_info = gather_diagnostics()
    relaunch_implementer_with_diagnostics(diagnostic_info)
    attempt_count += 1
else:
    log_deferred_feature()  # Not "failed" - just deferred
    add_to_later_queue()  # Will retry after other features
    
# NEVER BREAK OR EXIT - ALWAYS CONTINUE
continue_to_next_feature()
```

### 3.4 Git Commit Protocol
On successful verification:
```bash
# Analyze changes
git status
git diff

# Commit with conventional message
git commit -m "feat(component): implement [feature_name]

- [Key change 1]
- [Key change 2]
- [Key change 3]

Autonomous session - Iteration #[number]
Continuous development since [start_time]"
```

### 3.5 Backlog Regeneration
When feature queue empty:
```python
def generate_improvement_task():
    """Never run out of work - always find something to improve"""
    
    options = [
        analyze_code_for_refactoring_opportunities(),
        find_missing_tests(),
        identify_documentation_gaps(),
        detect_performance_bottlenecks(),
        find_accessibility_improvements(),
        identify_security_enhancements(),
        discover_ux_improvements(),
        find_technical_debt(),
        identify_deprecated_patterns(),
        generate_helper_utilities()
    ]
    
    return highest_value_improvement(options)
```
</infinite_implementation_loop>

<resilience_mechanisms>
## Infinite Loop Resilience

### Error Recovery
```python
def main_loop():
    while True:  # NEVER EXITS
        try:
            orchestrate_next_feature()
        except Exception as e:
            log_error(e)
            recover_from_error()
            continue  # ALWAYS CONTINUE
```

### Self-Healing Behaviors
1. **Build Failures**: 
   - Automatically rollback
   - Try simpler feature
   - Never stop

2. **Agent Failures**:
   - Retry with different parameters
   - Fallback to simpler task
   - Continue loop

3. **Git Conflicts**:
   - Auto-resolve if possible
   - Defer if complex
   - Move to next feature

4. **Resource Issues**:
   - Clear caches
   - Optimize memory
   - Reduce complexity
   - Continue running

### Adaptation Strategies
- Learn from failures (track patterns)
- Adjust complexity estimates over time
- Build knowledge base of successful patterns
- Improve feature selection algorithm based on history
</resilience_mechanisms>

<self_improvement>
## Continuous Self-Optimization

The orchestrator improves itself over time:

1. **Pattern Learning**:
   - Track successful implementation patterns
   - Identify common failure modes
   - Adjust strategies accordingly

2. **Time Estimation**:
   - Calibrate complexity estimates
   - Learn actual implementation times
   - Improve selection algorithm

3. **Code Understanding**:
   - Build mental model of codebase
   - Remember key patterns
   - Anticipate integration points

4. **Feature Generation**:
   - Get better at finding improvements
   - Identify higher-value enhancements
   - Create more sophisticated features

<usage_example>
## How to Use This Command

Invoke with optional parameters:
```bash
/global::workflow::infinite-orchestrator

# Or with specific focus:
/global::workflow::infinite-orchestrator "Focus on performance optimizations and test coverage"

# Or with design doc reference:
/global::workflow::infinite-orchestrator "Follow the roadmap in design.md, then continue with improvements"
```

The orchestrator will:
1. Analyze your project and find all planned work
2. Begin implementing features autonomously
3. Commit successful implementations
4. Continue indefinitely until you return
5. Generate new improvements when planned work is complete
6. Never stop working, never give up
