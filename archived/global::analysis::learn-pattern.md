Find examples of a coding pattern/concept/technology: "$ARGUMENTS" in the codebase and teach the syntax and patterns.

Follow these steps:

1. **Search for examples** using Grep and Glob tools:
   - Search for the pattern/concept across all relevant file types
   - Look for imports, class definitions, method calls, or configuration related to the concept
   - Find multiple examples to show different usage patterns

2. **Read and analyze examples**:
   - Use Read tool to examine 3-5 representative files containing the pattern
   - Focus on files that show different aspects or complexity levels
   - Look for both simple and advanced usage examples

3. **Extract core patterns**:
   - Identify common syntax structures and conventions
   - Note naming patterns, file organization, and architectural choices
   - Document how the pattern integrates with the overall codebase structure

4. **Teach the concepts**:
   - Explain the syntax with actual code examples from the codebase
   - Show progression from simple to complex usage
   - Highlight key conventions and best practices observed
   - Connect examples to the broader architectural patterns in the project

5. **Provide practical guidance**:
   - Show file paths and line numbers for easy navigation
   - Explain how to identify similar patterns when reading other files
   - Highlight what to look for when encountering this pattern elsewhere
   - Document any project-specific variations or conventions

**Teaching format**:
- Start with overview of what the pattern is used for in this codebase
- Show 2-3 concrete examples with file paths and explanations
- Explain syntax and conventions step by step
- End with practical tips for reading similar code

IMPORTANT: Focus on actual code from the project, not generic explanations. Use specific file references and line numbers.
