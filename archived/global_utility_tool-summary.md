Display a chronological summary of all tools used in the current conversation: $ARGUMENTS

Follow these steps:
1. **Review conversation history**: Look back through the entire conversation from the beginning
2. **Identify all tool uses**: Find every instance where a tool was invoked (Bash, Read, Edit, Write, Grep, Glob, Task, WebSearch, WebFetch, etc.)
3. **Extract tool details**: For each tool use, capture:
   - Tool name
   - Key parameters or command executed
   - Purpose or context if not obvious
4. **Format the output**: Create a numbered list showing:
   - Tool name in bold
   - What was done (command/file/pattern)
   - Brief explanation for complex commands (especially bash)
5. **Output directly in conversation**: Display the summary immediately, no file creation needed

**Output Format**:
```
## Tools Used in This Conversation

1. **Bash**: `git status`
   - Checked current git repository status
   
2. **Grep**: Pattern "function" in src/
   - Searched for function definitions in source directory
   
3. **Read**: /path/to/file.ts
   - Examined TypeScript file for implementation details
   
4. **Edit**: /path/to/config.json
   - Modified configuration settings
   
5. **Bash**: `npm test -- --coverage`
   - Ran tests with coverage reporting (-- passes flags to test runner)
   
6. **Task**: "Research authentication patterns"
   - Spawned subagent for background research
```

**Explanation Guidelines**:
- Add explanations for complex bash commands (pipes, flags, redirections)
- Clarify non-obvious tool parameters (regex patterns, complex globs)
- Note the purpose when context isn't clear from the command alone
- Keep explanations concise (one line max)

**Common Bash Commands to Explain**:
- Commands with pipes (`|`): Explain data flow
- Commands with redirections (`>`, `>>`, `2>&1`): Explain output handling
- Commands with complex flags: Explain what flags do
- Commands with substitutions (`$()`, backticks): Explain nested execution
- Git commands beyond basics: Explain the operation
- Package manager commands: Explain what's being installed/run

**Examples of Good Explanations**:
- `find . -name "*.js" -exec grep -l "TODO" {} \;` → Finds all JS files containing "TODO"
- `ps aux | grep node | awk '{print $2}'` → Gets PIDs of all node processes
- `npm run build 2>&1 | tee build.log` → Builds project, saves output to file while displaying
- `git log --oneline --graph --all` → Shows compact git history with branch visualization

IMPORTANT: 
- Include ALL tool uses, even simple ones
- Number each tool use sequentially
- Group related consecutive uses if they're part of the same action
- Focus on what was done, not why (unless the why clarifies a complex command)
