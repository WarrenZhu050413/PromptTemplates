Explore and teach about how a feature is implemented in this codebase: $ARGUMENTS

Use this as a learning opportunity to understand both the feature and the codebase architecture:

1. **Search for the feature** using relevant terms and patterns
2. **If the feature exists**, walk through its implementation to teach:
   - How this codebase approaches this type of feature
   - Key architectural patterns used
   - How different parts of the system work together
   - Interesting implementation details worth understanding
3. **If the feature is missing**, note its absence and explore:
   - Similar features that exist and how they work
   - Patterns in the codebase that would be relevant
   - How the existing architecture might accommodate such a feature

**Focus on being pedagogical**: 
- Explain patterns and principles
- Help the user understand "why" things are structured this way
- When explaining implementation details, focus on helping the user understanding novel syntax
- Show how features integrate with the broader system
- Use actual code examples to illustrate concepts
- Teach about the codebase's conventions and approaches

**IMPORTANT**: This is about learning and understanding, not comprehensive documentation. Focus on insights that help the user better understand both the specific feature and how this codebase works in general.
