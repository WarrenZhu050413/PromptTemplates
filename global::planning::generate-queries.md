Generate potential queries to maximize understanding and learning from the system based on conversation history and optional input phrases: $ARGUMENTS

Follow these steps:

1. **Analyze conversation context**:
   - Review the current conversation history and identify key topics, patterns, and technologies discussed
   - Note any code files, tools, or workflows that have been explored
   - Identify areas where deeper understanding could be beneficial

2. **Process optional input phrases**:
   - If $ARGUMENTS contains specific phrases or topics, incorporate them as focal points
   - Use input phrases to guide query generation toward specific areas of interest
   - Balance between user-specified interests and conversation-driven insights

3. **Generate diverse query categories**:
   - **Deep dive questions**: "How does [specific component/pattern] work internally?"
   - **Practical application**: "What are other use cases for [technique/tool] we discussed?"
   - **Comparative analysis**: "How does [approach A] compare to [approach B]?"
   - **Troubleshooting scenarios**: "What would happen if [specific condition] occurred?"
   - **Best practices**: "What are the industry standards for [topic]?"
   - **Integration questions**: "How would [concept] integrate with [other system/tool]?"
   - **Optimization queries**: "How could we improve [implementation/process]?"
   - **Alternative approaches**: "What other ways could we accomplish [goal]?"

4. **Create learning-focused queries**:
   - Focus on queries that build conceptual understanding, not just facts
   - Include questions that explore underlying principles and reasoning
   - Generate queries that connect different topics discussed in the conversation
   - Suggest queries that would reveal blind spots or knowledge gaps

5. **Structure the output**:
   - Organize queries by category (Technical Deep Dive, Practical Application, etc.)
   - Provide 3-5 queries per category relevant to the conversation
   - Include brief explanations of why each query would be valuable for learning
   - Prioritize queries that build on existing conversation context

6. **Include meta-learning queries**:
   - Questions about learning strategies and knowledge acquisition
   - Queries that help understand how to ask better questions
   - Questions about connecting concepts across different domains
   - Queries that explore the "why" behind best practices

7. **Ensure actionability**:
   - Make queries specific enough to generate useful, concrete answers
   - Include queries that could lead to hands-on exploration or experimentation
   - Balance theoretical understanding with practical application
   - Suggest follow-up question patterns for deeper exploration

IMPORTANT: Generate queries that maximize learning value by connecting concepts, revealing underlying principles, and encouraging active exploration rather than passive consumption of information.

Example output format:
```
## Technical Deep Dive
- How does [specific mechanism] handle [edge case] internally?
- What are the performance implications of [approach] at scale?

## Practical Application  
- How would you implement [concept] in [different context]?
- What real-world scenarios would benefit from [technique]?

## Comparative Analysis
- How does [method A] compare to [method B] in terms of [criteria]?
- When would you choose [approach X] over [approach Y]?

## Meta-Learning
- What patterns emerge when comparing [different solutions]?
- How can understanding [concept] improve problem-solving in [domain]?
```
